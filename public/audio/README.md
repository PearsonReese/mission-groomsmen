## Fallback Behavior

If no audio file is present:
- The app will show "(Audio not available)" in the controls
- All functionality will work normally without audio
- No errors will be thrown - graceful degradation

## Alternative Audio Files

You can also use any spy/action themed music by renaming it to `mission-impossible-theme.mp3`. The app will play whatever file is at that location.

## Legal Note

Ensure you have proper licensing for any copyrighted music used in production deployments. For personal use or demos, royalty-free alternatives work great!
